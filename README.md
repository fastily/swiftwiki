# SWIFTWIKI
swiftwiki is a Swift client framework wrapping the [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) API.  It can be used by developers to create bots/tools, or to perform analytics on any Wiki with API access.  swiftwiki is under active development so files, classes, or functions may move, change, or disappear without warning.

NB: swiftwiki is a work in progress translation of my other API library, [jwiki](https://github.com/fastily/jwiki).  So stay tuned, more fun stuff on the way :)
