# SWIFTWIKI
swiftwiki is a Swift [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) API client-side library.  It is intended to be used by developers to build bots/tools and/or perform analytics on a Wiki.  swiftwiki is under active development so files, classes, or functions may move, change, or disappear without warning.

NB: This is a work in progress translation of my other library, [jwiki](https://github.com/fastily/jwiki).  So stay tuned, more fun stuff on the way.
